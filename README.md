# virtual-art-drawing-tool-app
A virtual canvas drawing tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I have used 3 of these web APIs:
        Canvas API – for drawing.
        Background Tasks API – for saving the sketch automatically every few seconds.
        Network Information API – to show network status.
        
This tool can be helpful in many ways:

Freehand Drawing:
         You can draw freely on the canvas using different colors, just like sketching on paper.

Color Practice for Kids:
         Kids can use this tool to learn and practice using different colors while drawing or coloring shapes.

Typing and Writing on Canvas:
         You can type and place text anywhere on the drawing canvas.

Clear and Redraw:
         The "Clear" button helps you erase everything and start over whenever needed.

Download Your Drawing:
         After finishing a drawing, you can save it with your own file name and download it as an image.

Saved Drawings Section:
         All your downloaded images appear as links so you can download them again later.

Offline Support:
         The app works even if you don’t have an internet connection. Your drawings are saved locally.
